        <p class="para"> Africa's deadliest snake, the black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) 
            can kill a person with just two drops of venom, Live Science reported.
             Named for the dark, inky color inside of their mouths, black mambas are
              actually brownish in color. They average around 8 feet (2.5 meters) in 
              length, and can move at 12 mph (19 km/h). The lengthy snakes are born with
               two to three drops of venom in each fang, so they are lethal biters right
                from the get-go. By adulthood, they can store up to 20 drops in each of
                 their fangs, according to Kruger National Park. Without treatment, a bite
                  from this African snake is just about always lethal.
