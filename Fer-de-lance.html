        <p class="para"> A bite from a fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper) can turn
             a person's body tissue black as it begins to die, accord
             ing to a 1984 paper published in the journal Toxicon. These pit
              vipers, which live in Central and South America and are between 3.
              9 and 8.2 feet (1.2 and 2.5 m) long and weigh up to 13 pounds (6 kg), are r
              esponsible for about half of all snakebite venom poisonings in Central Amer
              ica, according to a 2001 study published in the journal Toxicon. Because 
              fer-de-lance venom contains an anticoagulant (a substance that hinders b
              lood clotting), a bite from this snake can cause a person to hemorrhage.
